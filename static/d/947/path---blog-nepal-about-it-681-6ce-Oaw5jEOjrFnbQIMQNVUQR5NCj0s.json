He took us out to dinner at Yangling, a famous Nepalese restaurant for incredible chili momos (Nepalese dumplings) and a lot of good chats about how Take on Nepal was formed.  Som grew up in a small village called Batase a few hours from Kathmandu (more on that later), which had no school past primary.  Wanting to go to high school, Som moved to Kathmandu to board with a family who instead forced him to work for them.  He managed to return to Batase a few years later, but couldn't do the enormous trek to the nearest high school every day.  He ended up working as a porter for a company, then freelancing as a guide and managed to learn multiple langauges.  This led to an opportunity to study in Cairns, Australia.  While there, he met his now wife and they developed Take on Nepal as a way to fund a school and boarding house/orphanage at Batase. Som lives in Australia, but spends most of the tourist season in Nepal - we felt very privileged to have caught him for dinner! </p>\n<p>A few hours later Grace had arrived from New York and Kristen and Grant had arrived from Hong Kong and we were all ensconced in a beer garden!  All three of their bags had been lost during their stopovers (who would have thought a cancelled and then hastily rebooked Sichuan Air flight from Chengdu with a stopover in Tibet would have been the safest option for your luggage??) but with assurances it would arrive before we headed off on our hike, we could set into the beers and some long overdue chats. </p>\n<p>The next day involved much preparation for our hike, the Manaslu Circuit - a nine day hike (plus one acclimatisation day) of approximately 177 km around Mt Manaslu, the eighth highest peak in the world, including the 5100 m Larke Pass. We had to rent sleeping bags and walking poles, buy rain gear (again, more on that later), purchase crampons, snacks and various other necessaries to survive an expedition into the Himalayas.  Thankfully we had a glorious evening on the roof terrace to unwind, followed by a dinner of dal bhat with Anil our guide, and Bijay and Sanu our porters who were to be our amazing team on our hike! </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/4Dd4SuL6MV36ZDszNuuFtI/b733ae47713afc6dfdd0e40bc3259ac6/IMG_20190409_173013.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190409 173013\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/7doPzaNf55IKNVUnEDNCgD/fd45ff629144d4965a8e16efad3fba07/IMG_20190409_173955.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190409 173955\"></p>\n<p>We set off bright and early, with a whole day of driving to get to Sotikhola - the start point of the trek.  A very bumpy road - fairly standard for Nepal as we would find out... saw us arrive mid afternoon in time to settle into our first teahouse accommodation overlooking the Buri Gandaki River, sink some more beers and take a paddle in the local waterfall.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/3gwmFbHej2BgbQtQqktGDi/682c5579faadc4f416beb562e6332b33/MVIMG_20190410_071236.jpg\" alt=\"MVIMG 20190410 071236\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/6417uGTBwbDTxd3h4FlOJn/f7de728c33c44de2d9b2aa7bdb8afdfc/MVIMG_20190410_143144.jpg\" alt=\"MVIMG 20190410 143144\"></p>\n<p>Finally, we started walking!

So far we'd only gained 1150 m of elevation over the course of three days, but we were climbing steadily and approaching some beautiful mountain views.  We spent the evening playing cards and asking Anil and co about Nepal and the Nepalese language (including learning the word for donkey/stupid, which came in very handy for the rest of the trip).  Grace, Kristen and I ended up drinking a few too many of the delicious Gorka beers for our own good, considering the length we had to walk the next day, but we made it work! </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/2dea5orF5e25Nals0xBLG1/ef0da75f93346a1e3c519c0334a301df/IMG_20190414_073503.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190414 073503\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/487P2g4u0LySl2XkQVd4Hc/a455a7ee844c19eb0384e5b9bd3b223c/IMG_20190414_074312.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190414 074312\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/22cDppvtE0YV9ebU7pS6Ez/b2d0cef9d07799fe5dc8e7edc577ca7d/MVIMG_20190413_180823.jpg\" alt=\"MVIMG 20190413 180823\"> </p>\n<p>We had to make it work, because our fourth day was around 24 km of walking, with around 800 m of elevation (to 2630 m).
