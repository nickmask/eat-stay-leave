Stellar. </p>\n<p>The province of Guangxi has (deservedly) been the darling of Chinese travel for decades: with its incredible landscapes and amazing old towns, the provincial capital Guilin was the first city to open to tourists after the creation of the People’s Republic.  The Chinese refer to Guilin as the most beautiful place below heaven, and children learn about it in primary school.  It is, however, eclipsed by its smaller neighbours Yangshuo and Xingping, which are like Guilin on crack… It’s not for nothing that the guidebooks tell you to travel from Guilin to Yangshuo rather than the other way round – it’s good advice to avoid disappointing comparisons!</p>\n<p>We rolled into Guilin early on a very cold and drizzly evening and took a walk from the bus stop to our hostel through the enormous walls surrounding the Ming Palace to our hostel.  </p>\n<p>It being a Friday night, the night markets were in full swing.  We wandered for a few hours soaking up the atmosphere and had our first bowl of the famous Guilin rice noodles – as Nick describes them, the Subway of noodles.  Handed a bowl of delicate rice noodles, with spices, three types of meat and some vegetables, you then add soy boiled eggs, pickled beans, chili sauce, fermented bean paste and raw spring onions, a deep fried dough stick for dipping, perhaps some tofu skin, and then however much boiling water suits your desired soupiness. The Guilinese tend to eat this for breakfast (for which it is amazing), but we ate it for breakfast, lunch or dinner depending when the mood struck!</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/2cByGmuKs4sw0aD4HWvmcC/e90352d0c18c9c5f40b3372b5363213a/IMG_20190309_112542.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190309 112542\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/2Mvy3BZXqu9JcrJ2tZ57GU/4ef56c68fbffac5760b8678d1dc991ce/IMG_20190308_212721.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190308 212721\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/7k3Sh8l8AxR4nSFPaWmNEj/35def6b6ed11a948da54f454f1613bb8/IMG_20190309_130834.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190309 130834\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/5D03IJXaqB2A1yPF7BmXfI/98d0cb4eabffa9010177b1389ddf09c5/IMG_20190309_141812.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190309 141812\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/1tZdxEUL2hfXFYyKPD0Kjo/90581bf0d89ec11656a07cda5b2cb7c5/IMG_20190309_193545.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190309 193545\"></p>\n<p>While in Guilin, we visited the symbol of the city – the elephant drinking from the river – and climbed to its back (and through its eyes?! a natural tunnel through the ‘head’ of the elephant), as well as the Sun and Moon Pagodas and marvelled at all the pointy karst hills scattered throughout the city.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/i2bUQCtDvxEauZs4wkCS4/b0a1dfd79bbedbaf68978aecafee1c3b/IMG_20190309_152825.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190309 152825\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/45VuQKHOiSoRnHzkJD0jWE/f79d51de639056123f0bea859cf0c514/IMG_20190309_142521-EFFECTS.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190309 142521-EFFECTS\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/6uOA4xw4MufEeRboHkRQfH/9f1bc56e0aea3c7f7f2485aacc040930/IMG_20190309_151254.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190309 151254\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/1uFHUpBJid8XTBITtmaMVf/1f564742832af557ddd4a2895c8eb05b/IMG_20190309_210245.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190309 210245\"> </p>\n<p>We also took a day trip to a village called Daxu, founded in 200 AD and for centuries an important market town (the name literally means Big Market). The Lonely Planet had assured us it was a sleepy spot, however a bus route seems to have sprung up since that was written and the main intersection of the town was awash with weekending locals from the big city.  Nonetheless, a few steps from the main intersection in any direction provided beautiful glimpses into ancient shop fronts and cobbled alleyways. </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/4nkDd5ls4RWkWWqvZ88OHz/63b0544ea9348e2496eed316204be67a/IMG_20190310_141113.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190310 141113\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/1FvBfts9zUKpMOtbydLod3/123a6262c6df3d12adaa81995fc2c56f/IMG_20190310_134826.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190310 134826\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/4dqPuNL1pWeonqlHhk00Ij/4c17999fd6b51331e1e8d03f25ea54af/IMG_20190310_134621.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190310 134621\"></p>\n<p>From Guilin we caught a bus to Yangshuo (in what is becoming a bit of a theme in bus travel for us, we were the only people on the entire bus) and arrived in an absolute sea of karst peaks, with a crazy neon tourist town nestled between them.  </p>\n<p>Arriving mid afternoon, we took a punt on a minivan to Xianggong Mountain to watch the sunset.  A hair-raising ride through switchbacks and a very steep climb later, we rounded a bend to one of the most gobsmacking views of our short and sunny lives.  </p>\n<p>The sunset was a bit of a rort (we were facing entirely the wrong direction) but it didn’t detract from the hours we spent ogling the Li River and its outrageous array of mountains.  The viewing area looked like it was built to hold the entire population of China (that’s 1.4 billion, by the way, 1 billion and 395 million ish more than New Zealand), but we shared it with about ten other people.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/7oFFCPif8TDcPq3wfseGAR/73290bbcfbca3263b6a4b99d565dbda8/IMG_20190311_182730.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190311 182730\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/2lKoDKcjBtSlQM8Sudp917/c20823e9c089fa9f06eb91cddc2073e2/00000IMG_00000_BURST20190311164410479_COVER.jpg\" alt=\"00000IMG 00000 BURST20190311164410479 COVER\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/oS1te9ECmbqarvTSU1sdm/1ce7afffb4cdd04c0f5d39616f5a0863/PANO_20190311_180921-01.jpeg\" alt=\"PANO 20190311 180921-01\"></p>\n<p>From that bird’s eye view we took the worm’s eye view the next morning, embarking on a 40 km bike ride through the Yulong River Valley.  Having totally missed the bike path for the first hour or so (it was completely unmarked and it turned out it was entered through the carpark of a random hotel) we spent a wee while cycling through awful concrete developments and tragic blots on the otherwise staggering landscape before finding our way to the riverside.  Watching people punt down the river on bamboo rafts, stopping for lunch and a beer in a small village full of chickens and dodging selfie-takers tottering out of the long grass we crossed the Dragon Bridge by late afternoon and started towards home.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/2CIsUywz9p4iL1hzAK77Be/b017500171cc5acde43e936a43548b5d/00100sPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20190312121424087_COVER.jpg\" alt=\"00100sPORTRAIT 00100 BURST20190312121424087 COVER\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/7hogZ76uk9DdzhDHlZk4zG/70225e19bc940af290e615aa23a1684d/IMG_20190312_091008.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190312 091008\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/WCRJJI9u8JR9rmVV0okrV/ea91970c2727e3d3bfc865a28fb56914/PANO_20190312_181728.jpg\" alt=\"PANO 20190312 181728\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/1BOMWMNPhHoLAQVWnNw6OX/e841db9d509e3f5940eeaacddd35d5a7/IMG_20190312_124040.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190312 124040\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/5p16MxJesQVc5f5Kh4u0BR/6eaa0337fa9260884498d966d43ddf75/00100sPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20190312181836029_COVER.jpg\" alt=\"00100sPORTRAIT 00100 BURST20190312181836029 COVER\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/2WZaKKi2i2GVtwt4XiASzR/cc3516eab21535a33a3174ee50ae62ec/IMG_20190312_155124.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190312 155124\"> </p>\n<p>Already pushed for time, we soon realised Nick had a flat tyre – at the furthest possible point from our hostel!  However, the village ladies soon had him sorted out. </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/4aMMvAtU4Kvy8SXCgrWj2E/c4563a52823e49bf48b8ee6d6d573b4e/IMG_20190312_163235.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190312 163235\"></p>\n<p>By this stage we had very sore butts, but the even more incredible views that the still evening brought, and the more bucolic/less touristy vibe on the other side of the river powered us all the way home.

We also had to get a Chinese massage to recover from our bike ride! </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/5EaqLArDpe5FdobilSJbrr/be687e3df4545b6cb8a5d36ef4b636a2/IMG_20190313_141711.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190313 141711\"></p>\n<p>We were so lucky to see these landscapes when we did – with perfect weather but not bursting with tourists.  To little old New Zealanders, it felt like there were people and touts everywhere, but we just had to look at the enormous amounts of infrastructure in place for queuing to know that in the summertime you might not have space to ride your bike along the river at all!!</p>\n<p>Tearing ourselves away from beautiful (but hectic) Yangshuo, we took a bus with another couple from our hostel and one other young woman to the town of Dazhai.  Well, almost to Dazhai – we came to a halt in a lovely New Zealand-esque river valley and our fellow passengers managed to translate the driver’s message that there had been a rock fall and the road was blocked. We were to gather our things and walk over the rock fall and he would take us the rest of the way on another bus on the other side.  And – surreally - that’s exactly what happened!</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/15dn1Cv8h9q0oPZzYuxILk/05ea0ed561ed983f1af992a9c7ccb3e9/MVIMG_20190314_122605.jpg\" alt=\"MVIMG 20190314 122605\"></p>\n<p>On our eventual arrival in Dazhai, the five of us set off to our hostel, a 40 minute walk up the rice terraces.  A beautiful, meandering and very lost 2.5 hour hike followed, accompanied by a golden retriever who took it upon himself to adopt us, and we finally found our accommodation in Tiantou Village.  Thank goodness Nick had downloaded his standard number of apps at the commencement of this trip – we were saved by an obscure offline map app he had installed on the advice of a random Singaporean man we met at a train station McDonald’s.

Apart from a three-hour hike to the Music From Heaven lookout and the Three Golden Buddha lookout, we spent most of our time eating, playing cards, reading and losing at foosball.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/4qD7IEdqoaWis1d5Uwa0L6/5e250f793f565af826a66c4de581ef22/IMG_20190314_173159.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190314 173159\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/6kPVqbQQaesDxsbHFHkJ18/2e67ee9bceeeeb8481c1f43e6e0068ce/IMG_20190315_111844.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190315 111844\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/Qickt6WyjgqnLYmwPS8Pu/27cd007fcd4260261c7bbcdef9919dca/IMG_20190315_115743.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190315 115743\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/4AkxbRZNYuPFeVhn2VmlyK/aa3616270eafb44a126a771170dde497/PANO_20190315_121022.jpg\" alt=\"PANO 20190315 121022\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/6oFV7l7ADprwjMgoNC0m4D/967c15bafec0da9b29ea6d9905de40a7/IMG_20190315_181554.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190315 181554\"></p>\n<p>Our next destination, Chengyang, was similarly peaceful, but the trip to get there was so tediously time consuming we ended up spending only a few waking hours there! A tea growing area and home to the Dong minority group, the Chengyang villages are famous for their tea soup (which we didn’t try, sounds a bit yuck), ‘wind and rain bridges’ and drum towers, none of which use nails in their construction.  They’ve also been the location for many Jackie Chan movies. </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/2yC5fQFf1iWzo3Y69uIQM1/caa749d903abd430a60e292ca6db8290/MVIMG_20190318_091950.jpg\" alt=\"MVIMG 20190318 091950\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/4zvk9cUdn6waPpTxhyVytb/e95572f83b305dff6619ffbaa88f4fac/IMG_20190317_175153.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190317 175153\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/2XJBNmaYUc0BygFeLoPr5u/bd8059a1237ee6421bdd1cab5c174012/IMG_20190318_090917.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190318 090917\"></p>\n<p>Another day in Guilin followed, where we reunited with our buddies from Tiantou (those who climb rock falls together stay together), ate a lot of goose and tried the famous beer fish (Li River carp cooked in local beer) and some durian.
