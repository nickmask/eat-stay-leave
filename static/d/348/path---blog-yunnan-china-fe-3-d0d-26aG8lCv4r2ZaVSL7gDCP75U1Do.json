It was for years considered hardly part of China, with successive Chinese empires barely holding onto it from the control of barbarians.  The diversity in landcscape and neighbours is underscored by the fact more than half of the ethnic minority groups in China (i.e. groups that are not Han Chinese) live in Yunnan.</p>\n<p>Kunming is the capital of the province, and we arrived late at night to our cute ramshackle hostel.  Famously laid back Kunming has been considered one of China's \"most liveable\" cities for years, and calls itself the spring city for its great climate and beautiful parks.  Liveability for us starts with noodles, and breakfast absolutely delivered.  We wandered into a tiny noodle place and had spicy, sesame cold noodles for breakfast, followed by a homemade custard with black sugar.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/7fzQ6I21SmFOxlZhsEqdpd/91382289c179856762291f159c4721bb/00100dPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20190320104444818_COVER.jpg\" alt=\"00100dPORTRAIT 00100 BURST20190320104444818 COVER\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/4IQXKSWyE09RsrYVghcLQw/bc1605efd626cdaf2f09248be1210859/IMG_20190320_105931.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190320 105931\"></p>\n<p>We then strolled through Green Lake Park and did a spot of shopping for our Nepal trip that was looming ever nearer, and then decided to make a dash for a late afternoon visit to the Bamboo Temple on the outskirts of the city.  Perched on a hill, the 19th century temple is surrounded by bamboo and fronted by some seriously ancient cyprus trees.  A ceremony was taking place when we arrived and we sat and appreciated the chanting and drums.  However, we had to ask around to get the keys to see the real reason we were there - the 500 luohan, created by a master Sichuanese sculpter and his apprentices, each is a painstaking life-sized representation of a human man, in an attempt to catalogue the entirety of human existence.  Rumour has it that he based some of the less flattering luohan on a few of his colleagues and they were verrrry angry about it and he disappeared mysteriously very soon after its unveiling.  A shame, as his work was both incredibly impressive and bafflingly bizarre.  It's VERY bad luck to take photos of the luohan, so you'll just have to be satisfied with the temple grounds itself.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/6H2KV1FtCj55eDSr2Poe5I/a270322ed0a90927eae5ccbf95cda357/IMG_20190320_164023.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190320 164023\"></p>\n<p>The next day we visited the Yunnan Provincial Museum, a behemoth of rust coloured metal lurking in the suburbs.  Yunnan is an archaeological hot spot, with - among other important finds - the earliest known fossil with a jaw (the prehistoric fish guiyu oneiros) in the world and the oldest prehistoric human fossils in China.  There was juuuuust enough English for us to get the gist, so we were happy enough. </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/BP3JergKPmFuElYDwzB9V/c4ddfb4d81113c1009b7f3d75caac9eb/IMG_20190321_135352.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190321 135352\"></p>\n<p>After another day in Kunming exploring, getting our hair cut and eating, we headed to Heijing (not to be confused with the rather larger Beijing).  Heijing is essentially stuck in a time warp: for millenia it was one of the most important towns in the whole region, having natural salt wells (discovered when someone's black ox was licking at a puddle in the ground - memorialised, though abbreviated, in the name Heijing which means black well).  The salt industry made Heijing at times the source of more than half of the entire province's tax revenue.  When more efficient salt production methods were perfected a few hundred years ago the town fossilised, becoming a sleepy little village dominated by rickety alleyways, silent temples and ramshackle shops and houses.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/11RZBRSqn908iencgXPDaZ/1da711fddadf545396f324e0d9803b16/IMG_20190322_103520.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190322 103520\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/2gxeulPHJq1NdqLRGdUg54/f679eb9944a3cff03897ba7da92f3534/IMG_20190322_153056.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190322 153056\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/2L6qG5XHheDOwLruN0b8mN/b8607c3c9ab7bc1420bfb5eb6fc0a181/IMG_20190322_145653.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190322 145653\"></p>\n<p>We stayed in a pretty cool guesthouse called the Wang Family Mansion - though the room was fairly grim, the courtyard was a dream.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/16RDffiNdOGYmVBsc7iwnk/e7216c14a54a1ce1008d8ce34eff3521/IMG_20190322_144141.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190322 144141\"></p>\n<p>Next we headed on to Dali - squashed between Erhai Lake and the Cang Mountains, the very tail end of the Himalayas, it's an ancient city that used to be the capital of an enormous empire. The old town dates to the 14th century and has been beautifully restored and preserved. Interestingly, the town is majority Bai minority, which is a (fairly) matriarchal culture. </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/2c5oCe9nCYiPhoclPxf9O6/dc512c2b5298c70b4ea0cbaa823ebb02/IMG_20190324_192334.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190324 192334\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/4XtMk93mQSJHZDUqudSBQR/466a2f0f7d38558020f1fac5250eb091/IMG_20190324_192705.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190324 192705\"></p>\n<p>We cycled to the Three Pagodas, deciding to take a punt on the enormous complex despite a thunderstorm rolling in.  Though many of the buildings are rebuilt, the tallest pagoda was built 1,200 years ago when Dali was the capital of a Buddhist kingdom stretching into Myanmar and Sichuan. It was pretty spectacular. </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/b2DF9Fon6Xv4umhIGFwoG/449d1a25942bbfedcde139bf37c7b534/IMG_20190323_165234.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190323 165234\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/5BlvU01hZmkCVoEM7KRbQo/73885c7cca775a3c52e3df2ffac46d5f/PANO_20190323_155100.jpg\" alt=\"PANO 20190323 155100\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/6z3ZsjDbxPi6RGDLBTpiIX/f212db9857e0e1dea3b48bcd64e43483/PANO_20190323_160658.jpg\" alt=\"PANO 20190323 160658\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/4UEKxSJqjyvlzoioakoShE/877172b6d68cd3d5a891f2b03b680549/IMG_20190323_164442_1-01.jpeg\" alt=\"IMG 20190323 164442 1-01\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/3VTL4Oksn7TIcadF6rqArv/5b2161655b17061d4ff2025cd05a5233/IMG_20190323_160204.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190323 160204\"></p>\n<p>The next day we spent largely around Erhai Lake, a fairly uninspiring stretch of water that was most interesting for its domestic tourism appeal:  insane amounts of photoshoots for both wedding shoots and women with props... </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/5fi7hdpt8XM7gE9Na5A38r/fcf698c4521a26bbd78f84c49d5e5f5f/IMG_20190324_150023.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190324 150023\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/7IaBPR26e1hM6mwu04FruK/172f1a5e7af0483198c9768438860e9f/IMG_20190324_150146.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190324 150146\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/yV4QjhAUHpSHV2Dyy9gnw/932ffb324e07d8aa59d69e97f079d7eb/00000IMG_00000_BURST20190324161237468_COVER.jpg\" alt=\"00000IMG 00000 BURST20190324161237468 COVER\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/2OmQTf8Ung04BCr6Zxbtid/3a759a0ec1e9b9c1f87fb0765a6b8042/MVIMG_20190324_161107.jpg\" alt=\"MVIMG 20190324 161107\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/5BGtZsEm1gVhnyahn05nRH/4bb045b50bf6beb3ee0db800a966babc/00000IMG_00000_BURST20190324161259419_COVER.jpg\" alt=\"00000IMG 00000 BURST20190324161259419 COVER\"></p>\n<p>The views of the Cang Mountains on the way back into Dali were pretty great though.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/287uiFCUn8vxtOiegJL4U2/7ee7e80766b5bb31ed8c6ec21e643cd5/IMG_20190324_171402.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190324 171402\"></p>\n<p>So the next day we decided to do a practice hike for our Nepal odyssey by climbing to the cloud path, an amazingly manicured path across the face of Cangshan - a small mountain at the end of the Himalayas which the Chinese call \"the eve of the roof of the world\".

We walked for three days through the gorge, staying in beautiful guest houses with spectacular views of the mountains, befriending goats, and eating liquid Tibetan cheese with deep fried bread. </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/2pyWhlNGiTTBuciRNd2Lv7/22a15e03c1a5a1ebcf75b051c695888d/IMG_20190326_190257.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190326 190257\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/2JtvUkkZPJ0dCWqWEX0idu/00188b7d4944a785d3a1a68a66cb9b8a/PANO_20190327_153611.jpg\" alt=\"PANO 20190327 153611\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/5R9HGZVL3WZ9P42YMayqlw/fae54dd5947a69c03a144226f4d320d1/IMG_20190327_201715.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190327 201715\"> </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/2awKIHVQ07lLrMlP7Ekk4N/ca32e113c0e5370049fdc847485e2010/IMG_20190327_154311.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190327 154311\"></p>\n<p>On the last day of the hike, we dropped down to the narrowest, most raging part of the river, where you could barely hear yourself think over the din of the water.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YgMHOmu0Vk&feature=youtu.be\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\">Embedded content: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YgMHOmu0Vk&#x26;feature=youtu.be</a></p>\n<p>To top it all off, we decided to take the shortcut up 'the sky ladder' from the riverside to the road.  170 steps on a rickety old ladder up a cliff.
