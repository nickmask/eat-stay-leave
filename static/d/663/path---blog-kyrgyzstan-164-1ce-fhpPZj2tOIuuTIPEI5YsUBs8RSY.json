We had entered Kyrgyzstan, the land of not enough vowels, at Irkeshtam, the only road border with China that is open to foreigners crossing, and home to what looked like two filthy huts and a ravenous cluster of taxi drivers with a captive audience! We had befriended a nice group of travellers en route, with whom we had undertaken the last part of the crossing, so we had some bargaining power - but not a lot! One lad had good English and we managed to arrange a bearable price for the group of us to get out of Irkeshtam, with Nick and I heading to Osh and our companions asking to be dropped off en route.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/2bzu1MRZByUWT7d1VUGFFV/c12d5ae75b332a2e54c74ab1d39466dc/IMG_20190522_160222.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190522 160222\"></p>\n<p>We set off, but back towards the Chinese border! A lot of consternation (NONE of us wanted a repeat of that day from hell!) ensued until we realised we were just picking up an uninvited passenger, some army fellow who insisted that our mate Angus get out of the front seat to let him have the best spot! A fair bit of grumbling didn't help, so we were soon sandwiched into the back together and off on an extraordinary drive through some of the best scenery we'd seen since Nepal. </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/3nT7jPXhnxhdOaFbSKMna/609319ca0713344b756ace3408764f2c/IMG_20190522_190205_1.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190522 190205 1\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/1MS91idtGp7cjlNsy4ViwZ/f336956ceaf4f2c7de00ae64e29be123/MVIMG_20190522_171403.jpg\" alt=\"MVIMG 20190522 171403\"></p>\n<p>Kygyzstan is a country we knew almost nothing about until we started planning a trip along the Silk Road - it turns out it's a spectacular mix of mountain ranges, alpine lakes, rolling snowy meadows and fertile valleys.  The cities have a fantastic Soviet brutalist element (I'm a big fan of Soviet architecture, what can I say!) and are cheap and safe.  It is also the only country I've been to where a significant portion of the people remain nomadic or semi-nomadic, breeding horses for meat, transport and milk and living in yurts in jailoo (alpine pastures) for at least part of the year. Warning, this is another blog that is weighed down with too many photos but I just couldn't choose... We got our first gawp at the famous Kygystani horse culture on the drive in, and couldn't wait to get back into our hiking boots!  </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/5QAlGpzNGS6ecyjfS3KMo/361698efead4c88e6c7c07b349455758/IMG_20190525_081930.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190525 081930\"></p>\n<p>Our driver and his army companion were also not keen on waiting, going hell for leather along hairpin alpine roads.  We dropped our Australian companions in a beautiful village not far from the border, then continued on with Angus at breakneck speed, which got even more frightening as we hit a rain storm.  Eventually, inevitably, the driver misjudged a corner on a slick waterlogged road and spun the car out, hurling us around in the back and careening towards the bank of a river.  Nick heroically flung himself on top of me, trying to make up for the fact that I didn't have a seatbelt but we came to a stop before we went flying into the river.  The driver barked the word \"hurry!\" at us by way of an apology and eased the car back on to the road before reverting back to just as crazy speeds.  It was only when we were well underway again that Angus queried from the corner \"Tess, did you scream 'WE'RE GOING TO DIE!!' as we were spinning?\".  You'll be pleased to hear that yes, I am that much of a drama queen. </p>\n<p>Needless to say, we were very pleased to reach Osh late that night, eat something cheesy (CHEESE!!!) and collapse into bed to sleep off the trauma of the Chinese border crossing and a near death experience!</p>\n<p>We cruised about the next day, enjoying the low key, friendly city of Osh, which is a 3,000 year old market stop on the Silk Road (not that you'd tell from the architecture, but certainly from the vibe).  We marvelled at what a difference a day makes:  though west China was not as Chinese as the cities and towns further east, we were undoubtedly in Central Asia and not China now, with the incredible mix of Russian, European, Middle Eastern and Asian culture that we'd never seen before. I couldn't find my way to a Russian breakfast fast enough, gorging myself on syrniki - a delicacy I've not had since living in Moscow in 2012 (and one of the main reasons I gained 12 kg in five months in Russia!)</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/69dMjlu9SWOMXV0MczPUjJ/30f2a2d4d7384d55ca47e180a21e07b3/IMG_20190523_093743.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190523 093743\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/7tExaEGZlVyVnnw6dzuxwN/5c1255c4f9d916a492b9686e8f0bf55d/IMG_20190523_093410.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190523 093410\"></p>\n<p>Next up was organising our ride for the next few weeks!  In the 90s, a Swiss NGO set up a system called Community Based Tourism (CBT) in Kyrgyzstan, which has flourished into an amazing system of community owned, run and managed tourism where you can link up with local drivers, homestays, horse handlers, hiking guides and almost anything else you think of.  We joined back up with our travel buddy from the previous day, Angus, who we ran into by blind luck in Osh while heading to our local CBT office.  Together, we decided to hire a driver for two weeks, who would be able to take us to all the remote beauty spots in the Kygyz mountains.  Our trusty vehicle? The misleadingly stickered adventure van (no link to Thomas Cook (RIP) - we checked, the stickers were just purchased for extra decoration!) </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/2Rxg8uzUPUSKtLmHT0GzcP/8cdb6d714ac5e69b71f950efdb27f011/IMG_20190527_085054.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190527 085054\"></p>\n<p>By that evening, we were off, heading to our first homestay in a lovely little town called Arslanbob.  </p>\n<p>In a country that is 90% mountain, Arslanbob is an uncharacteristic ancient forested valley.  The forest itself, amazingly, is walnut trees, likely the original source of every other walnut in the world, spread throughout Europe by Alexander the Great who was welcomed by the incredibly hospitable people here as he passed through. Because of the way the Soviets carved Central Asia into states during the USSR, the people who live in Arslanbob are actually Uzbeks and speak Uzbeki. </p>\n<p>We didn't have particularly good weather, so the beautiful mountainous backdrop to the forested valley never materialised out of the clouds, but we had an incredibly restful time eating like kings on the balcony of our homestay, strolling through the walnut forests and making friends with the local wildlife. </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/42vJwKv6guAty5MIUWeb7u/94d00bc6966d4752e8aa418611e1d227/IMG_20190524_161910.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190524 161910\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/4HkJihn7DWPZSG8qznbo3M/5a07ec3b719d084e44f1ea443521eefa/00000IMG_00000_BURST20190524145601129_COVER.jpg\" alt=\"00000IMG 00000 BURST20190524145601129 COVER\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/16QqcOroqQpEYUKUPuJfVY/e217cdb8ad2e0a508d3f77590998dc55/IMG_20190525_071501.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190525 071501\"></p>\n<p>Another extraordinarily picturesque drive took up most of the next day, with cowboy traffic, herds of horses with their foals and beautiful mountainous foothills around every corner. </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/784oKQFpCCRZghXPouEGAs/830d2fdb13742166e41f3f1b220a7521/IMG_20190525_081842.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190525 081842\"></p>\n<p>We were headed for our next homestay and Sary Chelek, our first Kygyzstani alpine lake.

He was hoping to negotiate a regular tourist experience with him and his golden eagle Blackeye, and also get some promotional footage and pictures.  It was an amazing opportunity for us who just happened to be in the right place at the right time!  Worldwide, most falconers use hawks and falcons, but the Kygyz consider them amateur birds.  They hunt with golden eagles, some of the most powerful predators you can imagine - including being able to kill wolves and lynxes.  They are caught from the wild, trained for three or four years (Blackeye is still in training, and still not fully grown!) by constant contact with his/her master and exercises with stuffed fox skins.  After 20 years of hunting and companionship, tradition dictates the eagle must be released into the wild.  This tradition takes place across Central Asia, particularly in Kyrgyzstan and Mongolia, which still have widespread nomadic populations.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/53okHzGXN7zS3guh16KvVE/b0ff676e3cf03dfa3ace27c2874dbf51/IMG_20190529_154117_exported_1199_1559131975444.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190529 154117 exported 1199 1559131975444\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/7gcQVL7oinQrWZlcUQGyUH/8e02bd137e757fe5f9bc040d3bd63f9e/00100dPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20190529150006308_COVER.jpg\" alt=\"00100dPORTRAIT 00100 BURST20190529150006308 COVER\"></p>\n<p>Blackeye caught a rabbit, broke its neck and then guarded it until his master came, took it from him and then provided him with a meaty reward.

With our rucksacks packed, we crossed our fingers the rain would stay at bay and that the ice at higher altitudes wouldn't force us to turn back.</p>\n<p>The plan was to follow the Karakol river up the valley to a summer yurt camp, stay the night, continue to Lake Ala Kul at 3,500 m and head over the pass down into the Arashan Valley to a second yurt camp (complete with hot springs) and out the other side.  Unfortunately, no one could tell us whether the yurts had arrived for ther summer, how much snow would be at the top and what the avalanche risk was! We decided to play it by ear. </p>\n<p>We set off up the valley, with sunshine and horses and the views started rolling in immediately!

We couldn't say no to that kind of offer and so spent half an hour being slammed around in the back of the truck, then transferred to a smelly old jeep and ferried back into town, triumphant! </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/ks1b7y6sttxc/30cNWGk72n0AK6KGXF6ZmT/2bad813504202c36a419bba566574035/IMG_20190601_152840.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 20190601 152840\"></p>\n<p>However, we couldn't leave Karakol without a hot pool soak.  So, we made our way to Ayu Tor, one of the strangest places we went in Kyrgyzstan - a seemingly deserted soviet sanitorium with indoor and outdoor mineral hot pools.
